        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Directory and File Trees</strong> — Built an abstract object in C to represent and manipulate directory and file trees using modular components and invariant checkers. Weighed various design tradeoffs of abstraction, encapsulation, and code readability to improve the overall code quality.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Symbol Table Module</strong> — Created an abstract data type employing linked lists and dynamically resizing hash tables for generic symbol tables using C.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>BigIntAdd in Assembly</strong> — Implemented high-precision integer addition in assembly language to outperform the compiler-optimized C version for computing large Fibonacci numbers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Fraud Detection</strong> — Implemented a machine language model in Java to detect fraudulent credit card purchases via dimensionality reduction with clustering, utilizing weak decision stump learners, and improving the weak learners using an AdaBoost technique.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Discrete Time Step Climate Model</strong> — Projected climate change via an Earth system model in Excel that couples the global water, energy, and carbon cycles. Expanded this model to a Python application that calculates the social cost of carbon based on financial input parameters used by the IPCC.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Fire Safety Device</strong> — Constructed a prototype, "AlFReD," an Anti-Fire, Retracting Door Mechanism utilizing an Arduino board to close doors based on the detected smoke density and temperature values, diminishing the spread of fires indoors.
            </li>
        </ul>
